## Important Notes / FAQ's
:question: _Sometimes the camera snaps when firing a weapon_

:bulb: Although most shake and recoil has been removed, some still remain, will update when fixed

---
:question: _The HUD is stuck to my head during the "Shady Meetup" mission_

:bulb: This is a work-a-round I had to settle for, you can still Aim and Shoot with your Right Motion Controller

---
:question: _How can I remove the Crosshair COMPLETELY_

:bulb: The Crosshair can be removed via the in-game settings

---

:question: _Some cut-scenes have no subtitles_

:bulb: The UI has been removed to remove black bars from cut-scenes, this means that the subtitles for those parts are also invisible
